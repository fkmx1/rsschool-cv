### Code examples
I love Fibonacci numbers in general, but I must admit I love some more than others.

I would like for you to write me a function that, when given a number n (n >= 1 ), returns the nth number in the Fibonacci Sequence.

For example:
```
nthFibo(4) == 2
```
Because 2 is the 4th number in the Fibonacci Sequence.

For reference, the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.
### Solution
```
function nthFibo(n) {
  let a = 0;
  let b = 1;
  for (let i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
    let c = a + b;
    a = b;
    b = c;
  }
  return n === 1 ? a:b ;
}
```
